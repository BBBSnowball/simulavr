This is a little sample project to demonstrate usage of pysimulavr. It's written
as a unittest. You can start it by::

  > make do_example
  
So you can see, how easy it's to write unittests for simulavr or also for your
avr code. But you can use pysimulavr also for other things, look at example.py
how to use pysimulavr.
