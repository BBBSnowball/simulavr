In that actual directory we have to checks:

make check

and 

make checkdebug

check:
make check start a simple gui and enable the user to enter new analog
values to the entry fields. You must press the update button!
And "->B0" give the output state of the Port B 0 pin. The 
simple application main.c will only use the analog comparator
and set the pib B0 the the value which is the result from analog
comparison!

checkdebug:
starts also the ddd graphical interface to avr-gdb which will then
connected to simulavr. After the gui from ddd is available and all
files loaded the avr programm can be started with the cont button.
The breakpoint inside main stops the program flow and you can step/next
to the programm. The gui.tcl enables you to give new analog values to
the ain0 and ain1 pins so you can observe the comparator action.
