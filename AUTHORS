Patches submitted by Oleg Batrashev:
    - configure.ac & src/Makefile.am to complain about missing swig,
        and to flow TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC to output makefile.

Patched submitted by Russell Shaw:
    - bootstrap & configure.ac patch to cleanup use of autotools. It
        was very welcome to see tcl features updated to use
        tclConfig.sh and my silly echo's replaced as well.
