Help Wanted
===========

There are many things we could use help with on this project.
Here are some things that you may be able to help us out with:

* First paragraph of each chapter in this document (authored in
  texinfo) is not indented the way the content paragraphs are...this
  leads to strange formatting, IMHO. Hints on how to better structure this
  document are welcome!
* Running simulavr as part of the WinAVR tool chain.
* Grouping of identical AVR hardware, such as: What kind of timers
  are around 8bit vs. 16bit, functions, PWM...

The overview of the identical named but different hardware is necessary
for the future development steps.
