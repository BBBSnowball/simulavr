+ Host specific issues
  - Cygwin: Cannot use library objects built for DLL as static
  - Mingw: Uses BSD sockets.  Need to have WinSock as alternative

+ Feature parity with avrtest.  Known issues:
  - Support avrtest magic addresses 
      STDIO_PORT 0x52
      EXIT_PORT  0x4F
      ABORT_PORT 0x49

+ Feature parity with simulavr.  Known issues:
  - avr-libc mostly tests with AT90S8515 and ATmega128 so most is OK
  - Models not yet supported:
      + AT90S2313 -
      + AT90S4414 - essentially AT90S8515 w/less memory so easy
      + AT90S8515 -
      + ATmega8 -
      + ATmega48 -
      + ATmega88 -
      + ATmega16 -
      + ATmega32 -
      + AT90S1200 - different, can be ignored as obsolete
      + ATmega103 - can be ignored as obsolete
      + range of AT43USBxxx controllers - can be ignored as replaced (sorta)
        by the AT90USB* / ATmega???U? devices.
   - simulavr has a core dump feature

+ Configure issues
  - Joel's Cygwin has texi2pdf but not a valid TeX install.  It configures
    OK but fails when building documentation.
  - libiconv.a and libintl.a are not needed on Fedora 10 but required on
    Cygwin.  They are forced in on Cygwin now.  Can we know dynamically
    if these are needed?
