+ Host specific issues
  - Cygwin: Core dumps on a cout printing the device option string
  - Mingw: Uses BSD sockets.  Need to have WinSock as alternative

+ Feature parity with avrtest.  Known issues:
  - abort magic address
  - exit magic address
  - instructions executed limit

+ Feature parity with simulavr.  Known issues:

+ Configure issues
  - Joel's Cygwin has texi2pdf but not a valid TeX install.  It configures
    OK but fails when building documentation.
  - libiconv.a and libintl.a are not needed on Fedora 10 but required on
    Cygwin.  They are forced in on Cygwin now.  Can we know dynamically
    if these are needed?
